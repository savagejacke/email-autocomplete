## Setup

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install all npm dependecies

Create a .env file with an API_KEY

## Usage

to use the app.

Type you email into the text box, then when you're ready to generate suggestions,
click on the "Generate options" button and wait for it to generate. Once there
are autocompletions available, you can click the "accept" button on any of them
to apply that autocompletion to your email. If you wish to return to what you had
originally typed, then you will be able to click the "undo" button to do so.
